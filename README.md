# Book Store MERN stack project

This project implements an online bookstore web application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js).
It allows users to add, view, update, and delete books with a responsive frontend and a RESTful backend.
The application demonstrates the full-stack workflow with frontend and backend integration.

## Dependencies

1. Node.js
 – JavaScript runtime for backend development

2. Express.js
 – Backend framework for creating RESTful APIs

3. MongoDB
 – NoSQL database for storing book data

4. Mongoose
 – ODM for MongoDB and Node.js

5. React
 – Frontend library for building the user interface

6. Vite
 – Fast frontend build tool

7. Tailwind CSS
 – Utility-first CSS framework

8. React Router
 – Client-side routing for SPA navigation

## Approach

### Backend Development

- Initialize Node.js with Express.

- Configure MongoDB with Mongoose.

- Define the Book model (title, author, description, etc.).

- Implement CRUD routes (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

- Handle CORS and connect frontend with backend.

### Frontend Development

- Create a React project using Vite and Tailwind CSS.

- Set up React Router for navigation (list, details, create, edit).

- Fetch and display books from the backend API.

- Implement forms to add, update, and delete books.

- Improve UX with modals, alerts, and reusable components.

### Integration

- Connect React frontend to Express backend APIs.

- Test full CRUD functionality.

- Refactor and modularize code for maintainability.
